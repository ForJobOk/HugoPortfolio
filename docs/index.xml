      <description>I won&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to publish the article. I believe that I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will be useful to someone.
Another reason is that I want to keep a record of my growth.
I am not a special person, and my growth will encourage others to work towards their goals.</description>
