## PLATEAU Business Challenge

The event is an idea hackathon using city data called PLATEAU.  
All of attendees made a speech on their idea and voted one of the ideas they had thought was the best one. Luckily, my idea was selected and the member that voted for my idea teamed up.  
We met for the first time at the event. Even though we did not know each other, we helped each other and brushed up our idea.  
After brushing up, our idea was so much better than when I had considered it at first. Our presentation was perfect.  
Finally, our team and idea were commended.
